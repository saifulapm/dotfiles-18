> **NOTES:**
> 
> 1. The bspwm setup has some extra dependencies, see its configuration.
>
> 2. You can also change kwallet in bspwm for another keyring service if you don't
> use KDE as your DE.
> 
> 3. I'm using pipewire instead of pulseaudio but the pavolume script of my polybar _should_ work as expected with pulseaudio too.
